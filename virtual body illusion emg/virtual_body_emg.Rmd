## Project Description

Virtual body illusions have become and important tool in investigating bodily self-consciousness [@Blanke_2012] and are of clinical relevance as several psychiatric conditions entail distortion in the processing of one's body. The illusion, during which a fake body or body part is perceived as one's own, is often described as intriguingly vivid, although participants are well aware of its deceptive nature. 

However, relatively few works employing virtual body illusions have attempted to measure changes in the body schema at a behavioral, implicit level. Moreover, there is still a lack in understanding the role of tactile sensations in taking ownership over a fake body. We therefore started to work on both of these issues by setting up a technique to directly manipulate visuo-tactile congruency in participants (see Figure \ref{fig:ComparisonPhoto}) and to record changes in the body schema in a straightforward manner by representing body movement behavior. In the first study in this series [@Rubo_2019], we found that participants partly adopted the movement behavior of a more corpulent person after being confronted with a more corpulent virtual avatar allowing for congruent self-touch compared to the same illusion with incongruent self-touch. Crucially, this change was observable only at the implicit level, and not in common questionnaire measures.

The next study in which this Master's thesis will take place aims at a) obtaining a more detailed analysis of changes at the behavioral level by recording EMG and b) making the experimental procedure easier to reproduce for other laboratories by measuring behavior while standing and not while walking in a large room. Specifically, after installing the illusion either with intact or deteriorated visuo-tactile congruency, participants will be confronted with virtual objects entering their peripersonal space while they are standing still. During this phase, we will record electromyography (EMG) from the Erector spinae muscles on both sides. These muscles are innervated when moving one's hips sideways to the ipsilateral, but not the contralateral side [@Andersson_1996], allowing to map both direction and magnitude of even subtle avoidance movements.


## Master Student's Tasks
The master student's tasks involves further advancing the experimental software used for our last study [@Rubo_2019] which is also mostly publicly available (https://github.com/mariusrubo/Unity-Humanoid-AdjustProportions and https://github.com/mariusrubo/Unity-Vertex-Displacements). The software is developed using the Unity 3D Game Engine (unity3d.com). Additionally, the student will test the integration of EMG measurements using the Plux biosignalplux wireless device (PLUX Wireless Biosignals S.A.). A Unity integration for this device has already been set up, but best practices in obtaining EMG in this environment still need to be explored. Finally, the student will test the entire experimental procedure in a first pilot study. The student is expected to have at least basic skills in C# or another object-oriented programming langauge. 


## What We Offer
In this project, the master student will have the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology, combining VR software development with real-time processing of physiological measures. The research topic is both relevant for the field of human computer interaction and for clinical psychology. Note that this project's main supervisor (Marius Rubo) is affiliated to the workgroup of clinical psychology which is located about 500m from the School of Engineering and Architecture of Fribourg.

  \caption{Depiction of how we manipulate of visuo-tactile congruency during a virtual body illusion. The participant's posture in (a) is directly reproduced in (b). The virtual body in (c) is designed to be more corpulent, resulting in a loss of visuo-tactile congruency when the participant touches her hips and the controllers intrude the hips in VR. The virtual body in (d) uses a novel technique to preserve visuo-tactile congruency. In this project, we will use EMG to investigate how the difference between (c) and (d) affects the experience of a virtual avatar.}
